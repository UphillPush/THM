# Snapped Phish-ing Line Write-Up
<img width="1903" height="456" alt="header" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cd4145c-8211-42ce-88f9-a5e57fbf2d84" />

## An Ordinary Midsummer Day...

#### As an IT department personnel of SwiftSpend Financial, one of your responsibilities is to support your fellow employees with their technical concerns. While everything seemed ordinary and mundane, this gradually changed when several employees from various departments started reporting an unusual email they had received. Unfortunately, some had already submitted their credentials and could no longer log in.

### You now proceeded to investigate what is going on by:

1. Analysing the email samples provided by your colleagues.
1. Analysing the phishing URL(s) by browsing it using Firefox.
1. Retrieving the phishing kit used by the adversary.
1. Using CTI-related tooling to gather more information about the adversary.
1. Analysing the phishing kit to gather more information about the adversary.

Note: The phishing emails to be analysed are under the phish-emails directory on the Desktop. Usage of a web browser, text editor and some knowledge of the grep command will help.

## Answer the questions below
>![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Question-blue) Who is the individual who received an email attachment containing a PDF?



#### First, open the phish-emails dir on the desktop and right-click `open terminal here`, then we need to search for the file that contains the pdf attachment. This can be achieved through the command

```bash 
grep -l 'name=".*\pdf"' *.eml
```
This will return the name of the eml file that has a pdf attachment. We want to find out who received that pdf. The command is tunneled with `xargs` to view how this email was sent to in the command below

```bash 
grep -l 'name=".*\pdf"' *.eml | xargs -d '\n' "To:"
```

> ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Question-blue) **What email address was used by the adversary to send the phishing emails?**
#### The sender name of all files can be displayed with grep command too, as follows
```bash
grep -h -A 1 "^From:" *.eml"
```
Where `-h` is used to hide the file name   
&emsp; &emsp;&emsp;`-A` for displaying the line after the search keyword and the lines after, depending on the number follows <br> 
&emsp;&emsp;  &emsp;   `1` number of lines to display after the line match <br>

> ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Question-blue) **What is the redirection URL to the phishing page for the individual Zoe Duncan? (defanged format)**
#### For this question, we have to open the email sent to Zoe and download the attached html to inspect it 
<img width="1795" height="910" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-18 175342" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0be1594-7286-4eef-a214-3aff404add25" />
<img width="1798" height="875" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-18 175412" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da8fb663-f7ff-4d8c-999f-8cebc27fa606" />

<br><br>
Now, the html file must be inspected for any url inside it, which can be done through the commnad 
```bash
grep "http[^ ]" *.html
```
<img width="1132" height="337" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-18 175932" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fecd1a0-3253-4df7-b2e4-30704c38a282" />
<br> 
<br>
So the URL is:   

http://kennaroads.buzz/data/Update365/office365/40e7baa2f826a57fcf04e5202526f8bd/?email=zoe.duncan@swiftspend.finance&error    

  
This URL has to be defanged as required in the question, so Cyberchef was used to do it:

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

> ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Question-blue) **What is the URL to the .zip archive of the phishing kit? (defanged format)**
#### The phishing URL sent to Zeo has a specific path to her, but if we remove the path related to the user, it will direct us to some files it's hosting 
so for the link:   
http://kennaroads.buzz/data/Update365/office365/40e7baa2f826a57fcf04e5202526f8bd/?email=zoe.duncan@swiftspend.finance&error  
we will just keep the main path:   
http://kennaroads.buzz/data/Update365/  
<img width="624" height="312" alt="Picture5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80a14ab3-5ad4-4aaf-8bd6-227cbfae57d0" />
<br>
<br>
There is no `.zip` file here, so going back a bit to the link:  
http://kennaroads.buzz/data    

show us this page   

   <img width="624" height="303" alt="Picture6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e66c4b1f-14e2-4d7c-b9e4-7a3944e648c4" /> 
   <br>
   <br> 
   Now, we can clearly see the `.zip` archive of the phishing kit, which is Update365.zip
   so the link we are looking for is:   
   http://kennaroads.buzz/data/Update365.zip    
   
   defang this URL using CyberChef:   
<img width="1430" height="695" alt="Picture7" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d22b28d-70d0-4290-9310-5a1de12ed48b" />

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

> ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Question-blue) **What is the SHA256 hash of the phishing kit archive?**
#### Download the Update365.zip in the phish-emails dir, then in the terminal write the command:   
```bash
sha256sum Update365.zip
```

<img width="624" height="232" alt="Picture8" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5a3d8b7-99a4-46ef-9898-689ec866dec5" />

> ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Question-blue) **When was the phishing kit archive first submitted? (format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC)**
#### Using an open-source, popular tool for investigating viruses, VirusTotal is the best option.   
In my browser, I visited virustotal page and inserted the archive sha256 hash to scan it, and easily saw the submission date  
<img width="100%"  alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dd5610f-7af5-4716-9f1a-aa2217ffffeb" />

> ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Question-blue) **What was the email address of the user who submitted their password twice?**
#### The best way to track the login attempts is through logs, and in previous questions its know where are the hosting files  
so back again to the link:   
http://kennaroads.buzz/data    

a `log.txt` file is seen, open it and try to look up for repeated email or password

> ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Question-blue) **What was the email address used by the adversary to collect compromised credentials?**
#### To know this we have to investigate more in the phishing kit archive, heading back to the host website at:   
http://kennaroads.buzz/data/Update365.zip     

   the Update365.zip is downloaded, then we move it to the phish-emails dir to investigate it using the command
   ```bash
  mv ~/Downloads/Update365.zip .
```
Then Unzip it using the command  
```bash
unzip Update365.zip
```

  The file that collects emails and send it have the word send in it for sure and is in the Update365 folder, so searching for files that contain the send keyword using the command  
  ```bash
grep -r "*send"
```
we found

  The submit.php is the file responsible for the submit button, to further investigate it we tunneled the command with cat

Here, another suspicious email is found, and the responses are sent to whom is

<br>
<br>

> ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Question-blue) **The adversary used other email addresses in the obtained phishing kit. What is the email address that ends in "@gmail.com"?**
#### This one is easy, you just have to search for an email that ends with @gmail.com using the command:  
```bash
grep -r "@gmail.com"
```
<img width="1319" height="770" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88218dd2-ad78-4a3f-bb85-7f103140ebc8" />

> ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Question-blue) **What is the hidden flag?**

Reading the instruction for this one :   
<img width="651" height="160" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a401184-e86a-4eba-aa40-fbc8d4539d84" />  

  Then the flag is a text file that is a subdomain or a directory of the phishing URL, since there is no enumeration tool in the VM like Gobuster, I guessed its called `flag.txt`   
  so I tried this directory in the URL :   
  <img width="975" height="281" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42596687-eee8-4ac9-a91e-5ada5691f5e9" />
  <br> 
  So the flag is found, but it seems to be encoded. For that, we will use CyberChef to decode it back
